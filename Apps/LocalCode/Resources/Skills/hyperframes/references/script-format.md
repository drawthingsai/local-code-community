# `SCRIPT.md` — locked narration (optional)

The **locked narration** for a project: the final spoken lines + voice + delivery. It is an _optional_ plan-layer file — a video with no narration (bgm-only, silent overlay) has none. The storyboard's per-frame `voiceover` is the lighter, editable _guide_; `SCRIPT.md` is the _commit_. (Storyboard format → `references/storyboard-format.md`.)

This file defines the SCRIPT.md **shape** only.

Free-form markdown — there is no strict parser; the indented blocks contain the spoken lines.

## Shape

A header block, then one section per spoken line.

| Part                            | Holds                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Header                          | `**Voice:**` (voice), `**Voice settings:**` (delivery notes), `**Voice direction:**` (overall delivery) |
| `## Line N — <label> (Frame N)` | one spoken line, tied to its storyboard frame                                                                                           |
| `**Time:**`                     | the frame's rough window — a _guide_, not authoritative (real timing comes from supplied timestamps)                                    |
| `**Delivery:**`                 | per-line delivery note                                                                                                                  |
| indented block                  | the **spoken text** — the narration                                                                                          |

## Example

```markdown
# SCRIPT — acme-launch

**Voice:** Supplied narration
**Voice direction:** Confident, warm, a little playful.

---

## Line 1 — Hook (Frame 1)

**Time:** 0.0 – 3.0s
**Delivery:** Land the promise on the beat.

    Ship a launch video in an afternoon.

## Line 2 — The problem (Frame 2)

**Time:** 3.0 – 7.0s
**Delivery:** Wry, a touch tired.

    The old way? Prompt, wait twenty minutes, get something that misses.
```
